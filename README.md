# Gnome-Headerbar-Dark

Headerbar style for GNOME 3.16+ with dark theme

## Why another user style?

The [user style](https://userstyles.org/styles/96733/headerbar-style-for-gnome-3-16) this is based on relies on a now-defunct [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkwdec/), so it breaks when Gnome 3's global dark theme is enabled. This theme one works for the dark theme and it only.

## Versioning

Even though it's a small css file so it's kind of silly, I'm going to use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). For css, I think that means:

- A **Major Version** change is when an old rule is removed, since this might remove functionality in old browsers.
- A **Minor Version** change is when a new rule is added, as it provides new functionality, hopefully without breaking previous rules.
- A **Patch Version** is when it turns out a css rule is not being properly applied, and gets bug fixed.
